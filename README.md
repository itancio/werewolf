# Werewolf
This is a C++ programming exercise from Professor Morag of CCSF. This is a project collaboration with Christian Davis and Anderson Pereira Nobre. I am responsible for completing the functions for file persistence, interactivity of the player, werewolf, teleportation functionality of the werewolf.
